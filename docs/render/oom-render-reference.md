- Units: all symbol lengths and object coordinates are integers in 1/1000 mm on paper
  ("native", µm). OOM converts with `0.001 * value` to mm everywhere [MC `MapCoord::x()`, LS].
- Map coordinate system: x to the right (east), **y down** (south) [MC, used throughout].
  PDF is y up: `x_pt = x_mm * 72/25.4`, `y_pt = (page_top_mm - y_mm) * 72/25.4`.
- `MapCoordF::angle() = atan2(y, x)` in y-down coordinates [MC `angle`].
- `perpRight(x, y) = (-y, x)` [MC `perpRight`]. For a direction east (1,0) this is (0,1) = south =
  the **right-hand side** when walking along the path. "Right" in OOM is always this side,
  "left" the opposite one.
- Rotating a local point (ox, oy) by r: `x = ox*cos r - oy*sin r + X`, `y = oy*cos r + ox*sin r + Y`
  [PS `createRenderablesScaled`]. In y-down coordinates positive r turns **clockwise** on paper.
- Missing XML attributes: OOM reads them with `toInt()`/`== "true"`, so a missing int is 0 and a
  missing bool is false (except where noted) [LS/PS/AS/TS `loadImpl`].

## 1. Colours and draw order

### 1.1 Colour references
- A symbol's `color="N"` is an index into the map's colour list: `map.getColor(N)`; `-1` (or any
  other negative except special values) yields nullptr = "no colour", the part is not drawn
  [LS/PS/AS/TS `loadImpl`; MAP `Map::getColor`].
- The colour at index i has priority i: colours are stored in file order and
  `colors[i]->setPriority(i)` [MAP line ~155; XML `importColors`]. In the ISSprOM file the
  `priority` attribute equals the position.

### 1.2 Draw order (the single most important rule)
- Every renderable carries `color_priority = color->getPriority()` [RNH `Renderable::Renderable`].
- All renderables of all objects are collected in `std::map<int priority, std::map<const Object*, …>>`
  [RNH `MapRenderables`, `ObjectRenderablesMap`].
- `MapRenderables::draw` iterates priorities with `rbegin()…rend()`, i.e. from the **highest
  priority number down to 0**. Priority 0 is painted last and therefore **on top** [RN
  `MapRenderables::draw`]. PDF export uses this same `Map::draw` path [MP `drawPage` -> `map.draw`].
- Object order, part order, symbol order and the order of parts in a combined symbol have
  **no influence** across colours. A single object's renderables are split up by colour and
  interleave with those of all other objects.
- Same colour, different objects: order is `std::map<const Object*>` = pointer order, i.e.
  arbitrary [RNH `ObjectRenderablesMap`]. Inside one object and colour, `PainterConfig` order is
  clip path, then pen before brush, then pen width [RNH `operator<(PainterConfig)`]. For opaque
  colours none of this is visible, so freemapper may draw same-colour items in any order.
- Do **not** merge fills of different objects into one even-odd PDF path: overlapping same-colour
  areas would punch holes. Emit one fill per area renderable (merging strokes of equal
  width/cap/join is harmless).

Priorities of the colours used (ISSprOM 2019), top to bottom:

| Prio | Name | C | M | Y | K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Black 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 3 | Green 100% | 0.76 | 0 | 0.91 | 0 |
| 7 | Blue 100% | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 8 | Brown 100% | 0 | 0.56 | 1 | 0.18 |
| 9 | Black 60% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.6 |
| 13 | Lower brown 50% | 0 | 0.28 | 0.5 | 0.09 |
| 14 | Lower brown 30% | 0 | 0.168 | 0.3 | 0.054 |
| 15 | Black below lower light brown | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 21 | White over green | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 22 | Green 50%/Yellow 100% | 0.38 | 0.27 | 0.886 | 0 |
| 30 | Yellow 100% | 0 | 0.27 | 0.79 | 0 |

Consequences: 501.5/501.11 fills (14/13) cover the inner half of their own edge line (15);
505.x brown fill (14) covers the black dashed borders (15) of a crossing path; 520.1 (15) lies
under every black-100% symbol; 418's white dot (21) shows over green areas of priority > 21.

### 1.3 CMYK for DeviceCMYK
- OOM's "Device CMYK" PDF mode uses `AdvancedPdfPrinter` [MP `makePrinter`], whose engine writes
  `QColor::cyanF/magentaF/yellowF/blackF` with `scn`/`SCN` in a `/DeviceCMYK` colour space
  [PDF devicecmyk.diff].
- The QColor is built from `MapColor::cmyk` (`q_color = cmyk` unless CMYK is derived from RGB)
  [MCL `updateCalculatedColors`]. So use the colour element's `c m y k` attributes (0..1) directly
  [XML `importColors`].
- For `<cmyk method="spotcolor">` OOM recomputes CMYK from the spot components:
  `x = x + factor * spot.x * (1 - x)` per channel, starting from white [MCL `cmykFromSpotColors`].
  The stored attributes already equal that result (checked: 14 = 0.3 x Brown, 22 = 0.5 Green over
  Yellow), so reading the attributes is enough.
- Normal PDF drawing is opaque painter's algorithm. Knockout/overprint flags only affect
  separations and the raster overprinting simulation [RN `drawColorSeparation`,
  `drawOverprintingSimulation`], never the normal PDF. "White over …" colours paint opaque white.

### 1.4 Opacity
- `<color opacity="…">`; if < 1 the QColor gets `setAlphaF(opacity)` [RN `MapRenderables::draw`].
  All ISSprOM colours have opacity 1. If ever < 1: PDF constant alpha (ExtGState `/ca`, `/CA`).
- Symbols with `is_hidden` are skipped, helper symbols are skipped unless enabled [RN `draw`].

---

## 2. Line symbols

### 2.1 Basic line [LS `createSinglePathRenderables`, RI `LineRenderable`]
- Drawn if `color && line_width > 0`. Stroke width = `0.001 * line_width` mm, pen only.
- `cap_style`: 0 Flat, 1 Round, 2 Square, 3 Pointed (rendered with flat cap + extra tapered area,
  see 2.7) [LSH `CapStyle`; RI `LineRenderable`]. PDF `J`: flat 0, round 1, square 2 [PDF `setPen`].
- `join_style`: **0 Bevel, 1 Miter, 2 Round** [LSH `JoinStyle`]. PDF `j`: miter 0, round 1, bevel 2.
- Miter limit: `LineSymbol::miterLimit() = 1` (Qt units) [LSH]; for PDF engines OOM converts it with
  `sqrt(1 + 4 * limit²)` [RI `fixPenForPdf`] and writes `max(1, limit) M` [PDF `setPen`].
  **Use PDF miter limit √5 = 2.2361** for every miter-joined line. Text framing uses Qt limit 0.5
  -> PDF √2.
- Each path part (see 7) is drawn separately with `closed = part.isClosed()` [LS
  `createRenderables`]. Closed parts: `closeSubpath()` -> join at the closing vertex, no caps
  [RI `LineRenderable`]. Qt's PDF writer emits `h` whenever a subpath ends on its start point
  [PDF `generatePath`].
- `minimum_length` is **not used for rendering**; it only drives the "line too short" check
  [OBJ `PathObject::isLineTooShort`].
- Simple case (no dashes, no start/end offset): the stroke is the unmodified path; borders and mid
  symbols are computed from the same path [LS `createSinglePathRenderables`].

### 2.2 Dashed main line (506) [LS `processDashedLine`, `createDashGroups`]
Only if `dashed="true"` and `dash_length > 0`. A part is split into sections at coordinates with
the DashPoint flag (32); freemapper paths normally have one section = the whole part.

Per section [S, E] (arc lengths in mm), with d = dash_length, b = break_length,
g = in_group_break_length, k = dashes_in_group (all x0.001):

```
half_first = is_part_start ? (half_outer_dashes || closed) : (flag(S) has DashPoint && k == 1)
half_last  = is_part_end   ? (half_outer_dashes || closed) : (k == 1)
H   = half_first + half_last                     // 0, 1 or 2
G   = k*d + (k-1)*g ;  T = G + b
L   = E - S
nf  = H + (L + b - H*d/2) / T
lo  = floor(nf)
min_opt_dashes = 2*k - H/2                       // C++ integer division
sw  = 0.2 * T / k
if L <= 0 or (lo <= 1 and L < 2*T - min_opt_dashes*sw):
    too short: draw the section as a SOLID line (if it is the last section),
               otherwise hand the length to the next section
else:
    hi  = ceil(nf)
    dlo = (L + b - lo*T) / lo ;  dhi = (hi*T - (L + b)) / hi
    n   = (dlo > dhi) ? hi : lo                  // n >= 2
    D   = max(0, (L - (n-1)*b - n*(k-1)*g) * 2 / (2*n*k - H))
    pos = S
    for grp in 1..n:
        for dash in 1..k:
            first = grp==1 && dash==1 ;  last = grp==n && dash==k
            len = D/2 if exactly one of (first && half_first), (last && half_last) else D
            emit stroke sub-path from pos to pos+len   // follows the original geometry
            pos += len ; if dash < k: pos += g
        if grp < n: pos += b
```
- The break length is fixed; the **dash length is stretched/shrunk** so an open line starts and
  ends with a full dash (unless `half_outer_dashes`). Dashes run continuously over corners: a dash
  that spans a vertex is a polyline through that vertex, stroked with the symbol's join.
  OOM does not snap dashes to corners (only explicit dash points split the pattern).
- Closed parts: H = 2, the first and last dash are halves; `LineRenderable` appends the first
  sub-path to the last one (`connectPath`) so the two halves form one dash across the closing
  point, joined, without caps [RI `LineRenderable` `first_subpath`].
- Example 506 at 1:4000 (d 1.5, b 0.37): open line shorter than 2*1.87 - 2*0.374 = 2.992 mm is
  solid. Count: n = floor or ceil of (L + 0.37)/1.87, whichever deviation is smaller.
- Caps of each dash: the symbol's cap (506: flat).

### 2.3 Borders (505.1, 505.2) [LS `createBorderLines`, `shiftCoordinates`, `LineSymbolBorder`]
- `<borders>` sets `have_border_lines`. The first `<border>` is the **left** border; a second one
  (only with `borders_different`) the right border; with only one, `right_border = border`
  [LS `loadImpl`].
- Visible if `width > 0 && color && !(dashed && dash_length == 0)` [LS `isVisible`].
- Centre-line offset of a border = `line_width/2 + shift` (mm x0.001), to the left (negative
  perpRight) or right: `shiftCoordinates(path, ±0.0005*line_width, ±0.001*shift, …)`, total shift =
  main_shift + border_shift [LS `shiftCoordinatesLeft/Right`]. So `shift` is measured from the
  **edge** of the main line; 505.1: 175 + 50 = 225 µm, border spans 175..275 µm from the centre.
- Border stroke: width = border.width, colour = border.color, **cap always flat** (temporary
  `LineSymbol` default), join = Round if the main join is Round, otherwise **Miter**
  [LS `createBorderLines`, `LineSymbolBorder::setupSymbol`].
- Dashed border (`dashed && dash_length > 0 && break_length > 0`): the dash pattern is computed
  with the algorithm of 2.2 on the **main centre line** (k = 1, no half outer dashes, closed ->
  halves at the closing point), then the dashed coordinate list (including the undrawn gap
  stretches) is offset. Left and right borders reuse the identical pattern unless they differ
  [LS `createBorderLines`]. Effect: dashes sit exactly opposite each other; on curves the outer
  border dash is longer than the inner one.
- If the main line is dashed, borders are built from the processed (dashed) path; not the case for
  505.x (main line solid).
- Too short for dashes (505 at 1:4000: open L < 2*2.25 - 2*0.45 = 3.6 mm): solid border.

Offset algorithm per vertex (shift = signed total shift, t_in/t_out unit tangents from
`calculateIncomingTangent/OutgoingTangent`, which wrap around for closed parts) [LS `shiftCoordinates`]:
```
open start:  P = c + shift*perpRight(t_out)          open end: P = c + shift*perpRight(t_in)
corner:
  mid = normalize(t_in + t_out)
  outer = (t_out.x*t_in.y - t_in.x*t_out.y) * shift > 0
  if outer and join == Miter:
     if dot(mid, t_in) <= cos(atan(4/2)) = 0.4472    // deflection >= 126.87 deg
        mid1 = normalize(t_in + mid); off = 2*|main_shift| + tan(acos(dot(mid1,t_in)))*|border_shift|
        emit c + shift*perpRight(t_in) + off*t_in ;  P = c + shift*perpRight(t_out) - off*t_out
     else
        off = |shift / tan(acos(dot(perpRight(mid), t_in)))|  // = |shift|*tan(deflection/2)
        P = c + shift*perpRight(t_out) - off*t_out          // exact miter point
  if outer and join in {Bevel, Round}: two points with off = tan(phi1)*|border_shift| (+ middle point for Round)
  inner side (no Bézier on both sides):
     phi = acos(dot(perpRight(mid), t_in)); off = -|shift/tan(phi)|   // intersection of offset lines
     if tan(phi) >= 1 or |off| < min(len_in, len_out): P = c + shift*perpRight(t_out) - off*t_out
     elif len_in < len_out: P = c + shift*perpRight(t_out) + len_in*t_out
     else:                  P = c + shift*perpRight(t_in) - len_out*t_in
  inner side between two Béziers: P = c + shift*inset*perpRight(mid),
     inset = sin(phi) > 0.5 ? 1/sin(phi) : 2
```
`len_in/len_out` = distance to the neighbouring vertex. Bézier segments are offset with
`QBezier::shifted(…, |shift|, 0.03)` between the corner points (approximate offset curve); an
equivalent is to offset a flattened polyline (tolerance ≤ 0.005 mm). The resulting border
polyline is then stroked with miter joins (PDF limit √5).

### 2.4 Mid symbols on solid lines (201, 513.2, 518) [LS `createMidSymbolRenderables`]
Created only if `mid_symbol` is non-empty and `segment_length > 0` and the line is not dashed
[LS `createSinglePathRenderables`]. `mid_symbol_placement` is used only on dashed lines.
`minimum_mid_symbol_count` and `minimum_mid_symbol_count_when_closed` are loaded, saved and
scaled but **never used for rendering** (grep: only `loadImpl`, `saveImpl`, `scale`, `equals`).

With s = segment_length, e = end_length, m = mid_symbols_per_spot, q = mid_symbol_distance (mm),
msl = (m-1)*q:
```
if e == 0 and not closed: place(S)                         // symbol at the very start
for each section [A, B] (between dash points; normally the whole part):
  L   = B - A
  seg = max(0, L - 2e) - msl
  raw = max(e == 0 ? 1 : 0, seg / (s + msl)); lo = floor(raw); hi = ceil(raw)
  if e > 0:
     if L <= msl:
        if show_at_least_one: place(A); place(B)
     else:
        dlo = |L - lo*s - (lo+1)*msl - 2e| ; dhi = |L - hi*s - (hi+1)*msl - 2e|
        n   = (dlo >= dhi) ? hi : lo                       // tie -> hi
        dev = (dlo >= dhi) ? -dhi : dlo
        ideal = n*s + 2e
        e2 = e + dev*e/ideal ;  s2 = s + dev*s/ideal
        if s2 >= 0 and (show_at_least_one or hi > 0 or L > 2e - (s+msl)/2):
           for i in 0..=n: for j in 0..m-1: place(A + e2 + i*(s2+msl) + j*q)
  else:                                                    // e == 0
     if L > msl:
        dlo = |L - lo*s - (lo+1)*msl| / lo ; dhi = |L - hi*s - (hi+1)*msl| / hi
        n = (dlo > dhi) ? hi : lo ;  a = (L - (n+1)*msl)/n + msl
        if a >= msl: for i in 0..=n, j in 0..m-1: p = A + i*a + j*q;
                     skip (i==0 && j==0); stop at (i==n && j==m-1); place(p)
     place(B)
```
- For m = 1 (all listed symbols) this is: n+1 symbols, the first and last at e2 from the ends,
  equally spaced s2 in between, where `e2 = e*L/ideal`, `s2 = s*L/ideal`, `ideal = n*s + 2e`, and n
  is the integer that makes `n*s + 2e` closest to L (ties to the larger n).
- Short lines (n = 0): one symbol at L/2, drawn only if `show_at_least_one_symbol` or
  `L > 2e - s/2`. 201: always (2e - s/2 < 0). 518 at 1:4000: only if L > 2.775 mm, else no tick.
  513.2: always.
- Closed parts: no wrap-around. Positions still start at the first coordinate: symbols at e2 after
  and before the closing point (gap 2*e2 across it) [same function; `closed` only suppresses the
  start symbol for e == 0].
- `place(p)`: position = point at arc length p (7.3). Orientation = `tangentVector().angle()` if
  the mid symbol is rotatable, else 0 [LS]. `tangentVector()` = `normalize(next - pos) -
  normalize(prev - pos)`, i.e. the sum of the unit incoming and outgoing directions: on a segment
  the segment direction, **at a vertex the bisector**, at an open end the single available
  direction, at the closing point of a closed part the bisector across the closing point
  [PC `SplitPathCoord::tangentVector`]. Points closer than 0.025 mm are skipped when searching
  next/prev (`tangentEpsilonSquared = 0.000625`) [PCH].
- The orientation is passed **unchanged** as rotation r to the point symbol (no sign flip):
  local +x runs along the path direction, local **+y points to the right** of the path direction
  [PS `createRenderablesScaled`; MC]. Hence 201 ticks, 513.2 half discs and 518 slanted ticks all
  lie on the right-hand side; reversing the path flips them.

### 2.5 Mid symbols on dashed lines (not used here) [LS `createDashGroups`]
`mid_symbol_placement`: 0 CenterOfDash (centre of each full dash, per-spot spread ±(m-1)q/2),
1 CenterOfDashGroup, 2 CenterOfGap (centre of each main break), 99 none [LSH]. Only evaluated for
`dashed="true"`.

### 2.6 Start and end symbols (541, 543) [LS `createStartEndSymbolRenderables`]
- Start symbol at the **first coordinate of the first part**, end symbol at the **last coordinate
  of the last part** (also for closed parts, then both at the closing point). Not affected by
  start/end offsets.
- Orientation (only if that point symbol is rotatable): start = angle of
  `calculateOutgoingTangent(first)` = `coords[k] - coords[first]` (first vertex farther than
  0.025 mm); end = angle of `calculateIncomingTangent(last)` = `coords[last] - coords[k]`. Both
  point in the direction of travel. Same rotation rule as mid symbols (local +y = right).
- 541: non-rotatable ring (2.4 does not apply) at both ends. 543: bar along local y -> a 0.8 mm bar
  perpendicular to the line at each end.

### 2.7 Start/end offsets, pointed caps, dash symbols (not used here)
- Only for open parts with `start_offset > 0 || end_offset > 0`: the line is shortened by the
  offsets (scaled down proportionally and the main line suppressed if their sum exceeds the length);
  with cap 3 the removed stretch becomes a filled taper from width 0 to full width
  (`radius = half_width * dist/cap_length`) [LS `createSinglePathRenderables`, `createPointedLineCap`].
- Dash symbol: placed at coordinates with the DashPoint flag, rotated to the bisector, scaled by
  `min(1/cos(half angle), 2)` if `scale_dash_symbol` [LS `createDashSymbolRenderables`].

---

## 3. Point symbols [PS `createRenderables`, `createRenderablesScaled`; RI Dot/CircleRenderable]

- Dot: if `inner_color && inner_radius > 0`: filled circle, radius `0.001*inner_radius`, colour
  `inner_color` [RI `DotRenderable`].
- Ring: if `outer_color && outer_width > 0`: **stroked** circle of radius
  `0.001*inner_radius + 0.0005*outer_width`, pen width `0.001*outer_width`, colour `outer_color`
  -> covers radii `inner_radius .. inner_radius + outer_width` [RI `CircleRenderable`]. The ring is
  drawn even when there is no inner colour (321, 541, 544, 545); the centre then stays open.
- Dot and ring are independent renderables with their own colour priority (418: white dot prio 21,
  green ring prio 3).
- Elements: each `<element>` holds a nested `<symbol>` (point, line or area) and an `<object>`
  (`type` 0 point, 1 path) with coordinates relative to the point centre in µm, **y down**
  [PS `loadImpl`]. Every element coordinate is transformed by
  `x = ox*cos r - oy*sin r + X`, `y = oy*cos r + ox*sin r + Y` (also Bézier control points), then
  the element symbol renders the transformed coordinates exactly like a map object (lines with their
  own width/cap/join/close flags, areas filled) [PS `createRenderablesScaled`]. Element colours are
  sorted into the global priority order like everything else.
- Element point objects (321's inner dot) use their own object's rotation, which is 0; a parent's
  rotation only moves them, it is not passed on [PS `createRenderablesScaled` comment].
- Rotation of a map point object: `r = rotatable ? -object.rotation : 0` [PS `createRenderables`].
  `rotation` is in **radians**, read from the `<object rotation="…">` attribute **only if the
  symbol is rotatable** (otherwise ignored on load) [OBJ `Object::load`]. With y down and
  r = -rotation, a positive object rotation turns the symbol **counter-clockwise** on paper.
  Rotatable among the listed: 521.1 (and the line sub-symbols' mid/start/end symbols).
- `<pattern rotation="…"><coord x y/></pattern>` inside a path `<object>` is the PathObject's
  fill-pattern rotation (stored as the object's rotation) and pattern origin [OBJ `Object::load`,
  `PathObject::getPatternRotation/Origin`]. It only affects area symbols with **rotatable fill
  patterns** [AS `FillPattern::createRenderables`]. All listed elements have none: ignore it.
- `elements="N"` is only a reservation hint; the actual `<element>` children count [PS `loadImpl`].

---

## 4. Area symbols [AS `createRenderablesNormal`; RI `AreaRenderable`]

- Fill colour `inner_color`; one `AreaRenderable` per object containing **all parts** as
  subpaths, each subpath closed with `closeSubpath()` even without a close flag [RI
  `AreaRenderable::addSubpath`]. Requires the first part to have > 2 path coordinates; area objects
  need >= 3 coordinates [AS `createRenderables`, RI].
- Fill rule: QPainterPath default **OddEvenFill** (not changed for areas) -> PDF `f*` [RI; PDF
  `generatePath`]. Holes therefore work regardless of ring orientation. (Text uses WindingFill.)
- `min_area` is not used for rendering, only for the "area too small" check [OBJ
  `PathObject::isAreaTooSmall`].
- `rotatable` on the area symbol: whether the object rotation is loaded; patterns have their own
  `rotatable` flag [AS `loadImpl`, `FillPattern::load`].
- Patterns (none in the listed symbols): `<pattern type="1"` line pattern / `type="2"` point
  pattern [AS `FillPattern`]. Rotation = `angle` (+ object pattern rotation if the pattern is
  rotatable), reduced to [0, π); lines at that angle measured **counter-clockwise on paper** from
  east, spaced `line_spacing` perpendicular, offset `line_offset` (+ projection of the pattern
  origin if rotatable), line colour `color`, width `line_width`, flat caps; point patterns place the
  point symbol every `point_distance` along those lines starting at `offset_along_line`, rotated by
  -rotation. Patterns are clipped to the area outline unless `no_clipping` [AS
  `FillPattern::createRenderables`, `createPointPatternLine`].

---

## 5. Combined symbols (501, 501.10, 521) [CS]

- `<part symbol="N"/>` references the **symbol at index N of the map's symbol list**
  (`map->getSymbol(index)` in `loadingFinishedEvent`), not the `id` attribute. In ISSprOM ids equal
  indices (verified 0..184), and freemapper appends additions with consecutive ids, so both agree.
- `<part private="true"><symbol …/></part>`: an inline symbol owned by the combination; scaled with
  it [CS `loadImpl`, `scale`].
- Rendering: every part's `createRenderables` gets **the same path parts** of the object, in part
  order [CS `createRenderables`]. The area part fills all rings (even-odd); the line part strokes
  each ring as its own closed line (outer boundary and holes alike), centred on the outline.
- The part order is irrelevant for the result: visibility is decided by colour priority (1.2).
  501/501.10: area 14/13 above line 15 -> only the outer half of the edge line is visible
  (ISSprOM: 100 µm of 200; school: 438 of 876). 521: line 2 above fill 9 -> the full 0.14 mm
  outline is visible, half of it inside the building.

---

## 6. Text symbols (991–993) [TS, TSH, TO, RI `TextRenderable`]

- `<font family size bold italic underline>`, `<text color line_spacing paragraph_spacing
  character_spacing kerning>`, optional `<framing>`, `<line_below>`, `<tabs>` [TS `loadImpl`].
- **Font size = em size** in µm. OOM sets `QFont::setPixelSize(256)` (`internal_point_size`) and
  scales the glyph outlines by `font_size_mm / 256` [TS `updateQFont`; TSH `internal_point_size`;
  RI `TextRenderable` `scale_factor`]. Qt's pixel size is the em height, so in PDF use
  `Tf = font_size_mm * 72/25.4` pt. Cap height is font dependent (Arial ≈ 0.716 em).
- bold/italic select the font style; hinting off, kerning per `kerning`, extra letter spacing
  `character_spacing * advance(" ")` after every glyph (`QFont::AbsoluteSpacing`) [TS
  `updateQFont`].
- Rotation: `rotatable` attribute; if absent, rotatable only for file version < 9 [TS `loadImpl`].
  991–993 have no attribute in a v9 file -> **not rotatable, object rotation ignored** [OBJ
  `Object::load`]. If rotatable: rotate by -rotation (CCW on paper for positive values) about the
  anchor [RI `TextRenderable`, TO `calcTextToMapTransform`].
- Object: `<object type="4" h_align v_align>` (missing -> 0), anchor = first coordinate; a second
  coordinate or `<size>` makes it a box text (word wrap) [OBJ `Object::load`].
  `h_align`: 0 Left, 1 HCenter, 2 Right; `v_align`: 0 Baseline, 1 Top, 2 VCenter, 3 Bottom [TOH].

Layout of a single-anchor text (`box_width = box_height = 0`), in text units (em = font size)
[TO `prepareLineInfos`]. A = font ascent, LS = `line_spacing * QFontMetricsF::lineSpacing()`
(= line_spacing x (ascent + descent + leading)), PS = paragraph_spacing (mm) converted to text
units. Each `\n` ends a line and (without wrapping) a paragraph; `\t` starts a tab part.
```
y0 = (v_align == Baseline) ? 0 : A           // first baseline, y down
line k baseline: y_k = y0 + k*(LS + PS)
w_k = advance width of line k (horizontalAdvance incl. kerning and letter spacing)
x_k = 0 (Left) | -w_k/2 (HCenter) | -w_k (Right)
if v_align in {VCenter, Bottom}:
   height = A + (n-1)*LS + (P-1)*PS          // n lines, P paragraphs (P = n here)
   delta  = (VCenter) ? -height/2 : -height
   y_k += delta
map position of glyph origin = anchor + R(-rotation) * (x_k, y_k)   [mm, y down]
```
- So: Top -> first baseline A below the anchor; VCenter (single line) -> baseline A/2 below the
  anchor (descent ignored); **Bottom (single line) -> baseline on the anchor** (last baseline on
  the anchor for several lines); Baseline -> first baseline on the anchor.
- Metrics come from Qt's font engine (hhea ascender/descender/lineGap on macOS/FreeType). Arial and
  its metric twin Liberation Sans: ascent 1854/2048 = 0.905, descent 434/2048 = 0.212,
  lineGap 67/2048 = 0.033 em -> lineSpacing ≈ 1.149 em. Take them from the embedded font's hhea
  table to match.
- Colour: `<text color>` fill (BrushOnly) with **non-zero winding** (`path.setFillRule(WindingFill)`)
  [RI `TextRenderable`]. OOM writes glyph outlines as filled paths (`ForceOutline`), not PDF text;
  real PDF text with the same font, size and positions is visually equivalent.
- Framing (not used): line framing = stroke of the glyph outlines, width `2*line_half_width`,
  miter join (PDF limit √2), colour `framing color`, its own priority; shadow framing = copy offset
  by `shadow_x/y_offset` [TS `createRenderables`; RI `TextFramingRenderable`].

## 7. Path coordinates

### 7.1 Flags [MC `MapCoord::Flag`]
Compact XML: `x y [flags];` per coordinate (µm), flags bitwise:

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CurveStart | 1 | this point starts a cubic Bézier: the next two coords are control points, the third is the end point (which may itself carry CurveStart) |
| ClosePoint | 2 | on the last coordinate of a part: the part is closed (its coordinate must equal the first) |
| GapPoint | 4 | legacy / internal (end of a dash in processed paths) |
| HolePoint | 16 | last coordinate of a part; the next coordinate starts a new part (hole for areas) |
| DashPoint | 32 | splits dash and mid-symbol patterns |

`18 = HolePoint | ClosePoint` ends every closed ring (freemapper `closed_ring`). A HolePoint on the
last coordinate of the object is harmless.

### 7.2 Parts [OBJ `PathObject::recalculateParts`, `PathPart::calculatePathParts`; VP `PathCoordVector::update`]
- Parts end at coordinates with HolePoint (control points of a curve are skipped while
  searching); the remainder after the last hole point is the final part.
- `part.isClosed()` = ClosePoint on the part's last coordinate [VP `VirtualPath::isClosed`].
- Area: all parts in one even-odd fill (4). Line: each part separately; closed parts get joins at
  the closing point and no caps; start symbol only on the first part, end symbol only on the last.
- An area ring written without ClosePoint is still filled closed, but a line or combined line
  part drawn on it is **open** (caps, no join at the start). Always write flag 18.

### 7.3 Arc length and positions on curves [VP `curveToPathCoord`; PC `SplitPathCoord::at`]
- Béziers are flattened recursively (de Casteljau halving) until the chord is ≤ 1 mm
  (`bezier_segment_maxlen_squared = 1.0`) and control-polygon length minus chord ≤ 0.005 mm
  (`bezier_error`). Cumulative length `clen` is the sum of flattened chords.
- A position at length p is found on the flattened polyline; inside a curve OOM interpolates the
  Bézier parameter linearly between the flattened samples and evaluates the exact Bézier at that
  parameter (`splitBezierCurve`). Interpolating on a polyline flattened to ≤ 0.005 mm matches to
  within that tolerance.
- Tangents: see 2.4 (`tangentVector`) and 2.3/2.6 (`calculateIncoming/OutgoingTangent`, vertex
  differences, skipping points closer than 0.025 mm, wrapping for closed parts) [VP].

## 8. Behaviour a naive renderer gets wrong

1. **Draw order is per colour priority over the whole map** (highest number first, 0 on top), not
   per object, symbol or combined part (1.2). This is what makes 501 edges half-covered and 505
   junctions clean.
2. **501 / 501.10 edge lines**: priority 15 under fill 14/13; only the outer half shows. The school
   set doubles the private line width (876) to show 438 (symbol_set.rs).
3. **Combined symbols** pass the same parts to every sub-symbol; the line part strokes every ring
   including holes, centred on the outline (5).
4. **Dashes are stretched** to fit whole dashes at both ends; short lines become solid; patterns
   continue around corners; closed lines put half dashes at the closing point that join (2.2).
5. **Dashed borders** take their pattern from the centre line and are identical on both sides;
   border caps are flat; border offset is `line_width/2 + shift` (2.3).
6. **Mid symbols**: count chosen by least deviation, end and segment lengths both scaled by
   L/ideal; `show_at_least_one_symbol` missing means false (201, 518); 518 on short lines can have
   no tick; closed rings do not wrap (2.4).
7. **Orientation**: mid/start/end symbols use +angle with local +y on the right side; at vertices
   mid symbols use the corner bisector (2.4, 2.6). Map point objects use -rotation (3).
8. **Rotation attributes are ignored** for non-rotatable point symbols and for text symbols without
   `rotatable="true"` in v9 files (3, 6).
9. **Rings** are stroked circles at `inner_radius + outer_width/2` and exist without a dot (3).
10. **Unused for rendering**: `minimum_length`, `min_area`, `minimum_mid_symbol_count(_when_closed)`,
    `mid_symbol_placement` on solid lines, `<pattern>` in element objects (2.1, 2.4, 3, 4).
11. **Miter limit**: PDF `M` = √5 ≈ 2.236, not the PDF default 10 and not 1 (2.1).
12. **Fill rules**: areas even-odd, text non-zero (4, 6). Do not merge different objects' fills.
13. **Text font size is the em size**; VCenter centres the ascent only; Bottom on one line puts the
    baseline on the anchor (6).
14. **Combined part references are symbol indices** (5); keep ids = indices when adding symbols.
15. **enlarge.rs**: `segment_length`, `end_length`, `mid_symbol_distance`, dash/break lengths,
    border width/shift/dash/break, point radii/widths, element coordinates and pattern lengths are
    lengths and scale linearly; `min_area` quadratically; counts (`mid_symbols_per_spot`,
    `dashes_in_group`, `elements`) stay; OOM's `LineSymbol::scale` also multiplies the two
    `minimum_mid_symbol_count*` fields, which is harmless because they are unused. Pattern origin
    coordinates and `pattern rotation` are not lengths to scale (and 0 here). Qt 5 `qRound` rounds
    negative halves up (-937.5 -> -937) while Rust `round()` gives -938: a 1 µm difference,
    visually irrelevant.
16. **Areas need >= 3 coordinates; lines >= 2** per part; zero-length parts produce nothing
    [AS `createRenderables`; LS `createSinglePathRenderables`].

## Rendering recipe

1. Load colours in file order; priority = index; CMYK = `c m y k` attributes; opacity 1.
2. Resolve symbols; combined `part symbol=N` -> symbol index N; private parts inline.
3. For every object, generate primitives tagged with a colour priority:
   - stroke(path, width, cap, join, closed) | fill(paths, rule) | dot | ring.
4. Path objects: split into parts at HolePoint; closed = ClosePoint on the part's last coord;
   flatten Béziers (≤ 1 mm chords, ≤ 0.005 mm error) for lengths and positions, keep the
   original Béziers for the strokes/fills.
5. Area symbol: one even-odd fill of all parts in `inner_color` (no pattern work needed here).
6. Line symbol, per part:
   1. start symbol at the first coord of the first part, end symbol at the last coord of the last
      part (oriented by outgoing/incoming tangent if rotatable);
   2. solid: stroke the part (cap/join from the symbol, PDF miter limit √5, `h` if closed);
      dashed: run the dash algorithm (2.2) and stroke each dash sub-path;
   3. mid symbols (solid lines with `segment_length > 0`): algorithm 2.4, orientation = angle of
      the bisector tangent, local +y to the right;
   4. borders: offset centre line by ±(`line_width/2 + shift`) with the miter rules of 2.3; if
      dashed, dash the centre line first (k = 1) and offset the dashes; flat caps, miter join.
7. Point symbol at (X, Y): r = rotatable ? -rotation : 0 for map objects, r = tangent angle for
   mid/start/end symbols; dot (fill r_in), ring (stroke radius r_in + w/2, width w), then each
   element transformed by (x cos r - y sin r + X, y cos r + x sin r + Y) and rendered by its own
   symbol (recursively 5–7).
8. Combined symbol: run every part (5–7) on the same parts.
9. Text: em size = font_size mm; layout per section 6 (alignment, ascent, line spacing);
   ignore rotation unless the text symbol is rotatable; fill colour, non-zero winding.
10. Sort all primitives by colour priority descending (31 … 0) and paint in that order, opaque,
    DeviceCMYK; within one priority any order; never merge fills of different objects.
11. Convert mm (y down) to PDF points (y up): `pt = mm * 72/25.4`, flip y; line widths likewise.
12. Check against OOM: export the same .omap from OOM with "Device CMYK" vector PDF and compare
    501 edges, 505 junctions/dashes, 506 dash counts, 201/518 tick counts and sides, 541/543 ends,
    text baselines.
