//! Control number placement: the box a number takes next to its circle, how a position scores against
//! obstacles, and the search for the best position (ADR 0038). freemapper-courseplan places numbers by the
//! same rules (its ADR 0030 and 0031) and takes this module over once it moves into a crate of its own
//! (spec §5.7). It therefore uses nothing else of freemapper-print; callers turn their circles, legs, sheet
//! elements and map detail into [`Obstacle`]s.
//!
//! Conventions: coordinates are millimetres with y down (page or map), so "north" is -y. A direction is in
//! degrees, 0 = east, counter-clockwise as seen on paper, so 90 points to -y.
//!
//! The rules, decided by the user on 2026-11-09 and shared with freemapper-courseplan:
//! 1. The number covers no point or line symbol of the map; area symbols may be covered and cost little.
//! 2. The preferred direction is "behind": the continuation of the incoming leg past the control.
//! 3. If the box at "behind" comes within half a line width of the outgoing leg, the preferred direction is the
//!    outer bisector, the middle of the larger sector between the two legs.
//! 4. If the preferred place is blocked, the free place that deviates least from it wins.
//!
//! [`best`] tries the gaps of a [`GapRange`] (ruling R29, courseplan ADR 0032) and ranks the candidates
//! lexicographically (courseplan ADR 0031 and 0032): overprint conflicts (own circles, legs, other numbers, sheet
//! elements, leaving the bounds), then covered map symbols, the angle to the preferred direction, the gap (so a
//! number first moves further out, then turns), the angle to the outer bisector and the direction. The soft cost
//! of covered areas only breaks ties before the direction.
